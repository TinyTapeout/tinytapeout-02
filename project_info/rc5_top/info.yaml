  top_module:  "rc5_top"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "RC5 decoder"      # Project title
  description:  "Increment/decrement a counter with the press of an IR remote button!"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "Decodes an RC5 remote signal, increments the counter if the volume up button is pressed, decrements the counter if the volume down button is pressed"      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "After reset, point a remote to the IR receiver. Press the volume up button and the display count should increase."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "Connect an IR demodulator (ie. TSOP1738) to the input pin"      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  doc_link:     ""      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     562       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required)

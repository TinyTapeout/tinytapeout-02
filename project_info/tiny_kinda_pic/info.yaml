  top_module:  "tiny_kinda_pic"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "Tiny PIC-like MCU"      # Project title
  description:  "serially programmed, subset of PIC ISA, MCU"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "Implements a subset of the PIC mid-range ISA (no SFR, no carry, no call/stack), 6 GPRs, 16 program words."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Program data is shifted in serially. For each program word, shift in {(1 << address), data} (28 bits total) to prog_data and then assert prog_strobe. Once loaded, deassert (bring high), reset and the program should start running. GPR 6 is GPI and GPR 7 is GPO"      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "A means of shifting in the program (e.g. another microcontroller, USB GPIO interface, etc) is required at startup. Once running, it is standalone."      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  doc_link:     ""      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     1000       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required)

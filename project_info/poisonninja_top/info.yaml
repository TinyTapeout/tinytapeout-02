  top_module:  "poisonninja_top"    # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "PWM Generator" # Project title
  description:  "Generates 100 Hz PWM signal" # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "The duty cycle inputs run from 0 - 50 and specify a duty cycle of input * 2" # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Link up switches to the duty cycle inputs and toggle them to set the duty cycle. Wire an LED to the PWM output to see the output" # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  ""              # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "Verilog"       # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc

  clock_hz:     5000            # Clock frequency in Hz (if required) we are expecting max clock frequency to be ~6khz. Provided on input 0.

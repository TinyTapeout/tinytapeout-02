#  top_module:  "seven_segment_seconds"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "LUTRAM"      # Project title
  description:  "LUTRAM with 4 bit address and 8 bit output preloaded with a binary to 7 segments decoder, sadly it was too big for 0-F, so now it is 0-9?"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "uses the address bits to pull from memory the value to be displayed on the 7 segments, content of the memory can be updated via a clock and data pins, reset button will revert to default info, you would need to issue one clock cycle to load the default info"      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "clk, data, rst, nc, address [4:0]"      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  ""      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "wokwi" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc

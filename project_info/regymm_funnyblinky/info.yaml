# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  description:  "Blink the 8 output LEDs in a funny way."      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "When function switch is turned off, all LEDs will be blinky. When switch is on, it works as a double 14-bit counter, to be used together with the mcpi module -- in this case we have pause switch and two output control switches to show all bits of the counters.

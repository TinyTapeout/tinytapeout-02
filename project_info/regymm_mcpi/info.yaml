  top_module:  "regymm_mcpi"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "Monte Carlo Pi Integrator"      # Project title
  description:  "Calculate the value of Pi using the Monte Carlo method"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "Having random x and y between 0 to 1 and compare the added squares with 1. Using 8-bit fixed-point number."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "SW 00: counter shows total sample points. SW 01: counter shows sample points inside 1 radius. SW 10: counter 0 and 1 will toggle, 0 for every sample point and 1 for inside point, for use with external counter. "      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed

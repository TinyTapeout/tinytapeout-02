# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "RGB LED Matrix Driver"      # Project title
  description:  "Drives a simple animation on SparkFun's RGB LED 8x8 matrix backpack"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "Implements an SPI master to drive an animation with overlapping green/blue waves and a moving white diagonal. Some 7-segment wires are used for a 'sanity check' animation."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Wire accordingly and use a clock up to 12.5 KHz. Asynchronous reset is synchronized to the clock."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "RGB LED matrix backpack from SparkFun: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/retired/760"      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc

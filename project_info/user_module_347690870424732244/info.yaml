project:
  wokwi_id:    347690870424732244        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID
#  source_files:        # If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. Source files must be in ./src
#    - counter.v
#    - decoder.v
#  top_module:  "seven_segment_seconds"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "German Traffic Light State Machine"      # Project title
  description:  "A state machine to control german traffic lights at an intersection."      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "A state machine generates signals for vehicle and pedestrian traffic lights at an intersection of a main street and a side street. A blinking yellow light for the side street is generated in the reset state."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Provide a clock, hook up LEDs and generate a reset signal to reset the intersection to all-red. If your leave the reset signal enabled, a blinking yellow light is shown for the side street."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "An additional inverter is required to generate the pedestrian red signals from the green output. Hookup your own LEDs for the signals."      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "wokwi" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  doc_link:     ""      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     1       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required)

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "Customizable UART Character"      # Project title
  description:  "This design implements a single character UART transmitter using registers made from D-flip flops and multiplexers."      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "This circuit implements a shift register with 17 bits: four idle bits, one start bit, eight data bits, one stop bit, and three more idle bits. The circuit supports transmitting a user-selected ASCII character from 0x40 (@) to 0x5F (_), including capital letters from the Latin alphabet."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Connect an Arduino serial RX pin to the eight output pin (Output[7]). In the Arduino code, set the serial baud rate Serial.begin(<baud rate>); in the *.ino file to 300. Set the PCB clock frequency to 300 Hz as well. Set SW7 to OFF (“Load”). Set SW2 to ON and SW3-6 to OFF. Set SW7 to ON (“TX”). Set SW8 to ON (“Output Enable”). Connect the Arduino via USB to your computer and run the serial monitor. If there’s no output from the Arduino serial monitor, try toggling SW7 OFF and ON again. You should see the character 'A' appearing repeatedly in the serial monitor."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "Arduino, computer with serial monitor connected to the Arduino"      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "wokwi" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  doc_link:     "https://wokwi.com/projects/347140425276981843"      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     300       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required) we are expecting max clock frequency to be ~6khz. Provided on input 0.

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "Femto 4-bit CPU"      # Project title
  description:  "Design of a small single-cycle CPU with simple RISC/Accumulator ISA"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "Contains a register file, ALU, and 7 segment decoder. Instructions are sent in from inputs 7 downto 1 (0 reserved for clk), the register source and destination are sent to the register file (synch write/asynch read). Opcode and register read data are sent to the ALU for the operation. The output data could be stored in the ALU, the reigster file, or sent to the 7 segment decoder to power the LED output."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Design was tested with a ModelSim TCL script, provided here and should be compatible with other TCL accepting simulators."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "None"      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  doc_link:     "README.md"      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     5       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required) we are expecting max clock frequency to be ~6khz. Provided on input 0.

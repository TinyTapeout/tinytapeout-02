# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  description:  "Seven segment display effect generator"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "Generates hexadecimal digits and 16 dynamic patterns on the seven segment display."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Use input[7] to display digits (=0) or effects (=1). Use input[6] to blink displayed digits (=1) or not (=0). Only digits can be blinked. Use inputs [5:2] to select digit or effect pattern to display."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed

  clock_hz:     12500       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required) we are expecting max clock frequency to be ~6khz. Provided on input 0.

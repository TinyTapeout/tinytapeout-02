# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "Seven Segment Clock"      # Project title
  description:  "Logic to drive 6 external 74hct595's that in turn drive 7 segment displays. The displays form a digital clock."      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "TBD"      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "TBD"      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "6x 74hct595's, 6x 7segment"      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  doc_link:     "TBD"      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     128Hz       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required) we are expecting max clock frequency to be ~6khz. Provided on input 0.

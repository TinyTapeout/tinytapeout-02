  description:  "Pseudo-random number generator using a 16-bit Fibonacci linear-feedback shift register"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "16 flip flops are connected in a chain, and the output of some is XORed together and fed back into the first flip flop.
                 The outputs that are XORed together are chosen in such a way as to give the longest possible cycle (2^16-1).
                 All bits being zero is a special case and is treated separately (all negative outputs of the flip flops are ANDed together to generate a 1 as feedback).
                 
                 On each clock pulse (pin 1) one new bit is generated.
                 Setting load_en (pin 3) to HIGH allows the loading of a user defined value through the data_in pin (pin2). On each clock pulse one bit is
                 read into the flip flop chain. When load_en (pin 3) is set to LOW the computed feedback bit is fed back into the flip flops.
                 
                 The outputs of the last 8 flip flops are connected to the output pins. For each clock pulse a random bit is generated and the other 7 are shifted.
                 "      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Set the switch for pin 1 so that the push button generates the clock.
                 Press on it and see the output change on the hex display.
                 
                 Using pin 2 and 3 a custom value can be loaded into the flip flops.

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "4-spin Ising Chain Simulation"      # Project title
  description:  "A self-contained physics simulation. This circuit simulates 4 spins of an Ising chain in  an external field." # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "It runs the Metropolis-Hastings monte-carlo algorithm to simulate 4 Ising spins in a linear chain with two external neighbours and an external field. Every monte-carlo step (10 clock cycles) a random number is created through a 32-bit LFSR and is compared to an 8-bit representations of the acceptance probability of a random spin flip. Using the inputs for external neighbors, N of these circuits can be chained together to create a 4N spin Ising chain."
  how_to_test:  "The design can be tested by enabling one of the neighbours (input 4 or 5) and leave all other inputs low, the system will evolve into a ground state with every other spin pointing up."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "None"      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "wokwi" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  doc_link:     "README.md"      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     20       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required)

  inputs:               # a description of what the inputs do

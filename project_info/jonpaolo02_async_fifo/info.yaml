# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "Async FIFO"      # Project title
  description:  "A very small asynchonous FIFO"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "After reset, run write_clock and assert write_enable with some data on wdata, then while run_clock is running, assert read_enable.
  If write_enable is asserted while full is high, the data will be rejected. If read_enable is asserted while empty is high, read_data is invalid."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "After resetting, test above behavior with different ratios of write_clock and read_cloc."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "None"      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "SystemVerilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc

  clock_hz:     5000    # Clock frequency in Hz (if required) we are expecting max clock frequency to be ~6khz. Provided on input 0.

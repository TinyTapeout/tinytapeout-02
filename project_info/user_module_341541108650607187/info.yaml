project:
  wokwi_id: 341541108650607187       # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID
#  source_files:        # If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. Source files must be in ./src
#    - counter.v
#    - decoder.v
#  top_module:  "seven_segment_seconds"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "4 bit counter on steamdeck"   # Project title
  description:  "copy of my tt01 submission, enable first input and press button to use the counter" # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "fsm that uses 1 input to progress abd count from 0 to 3. Other inputs have various logic to play with" # Longer description of how the project works. This was all done on a steamdeck
  how_to_test:  "enable first input so it is on and connected to the button. All other inputs are off. Press button to progress the fsm."# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  ""      # Describe any external hardware needed

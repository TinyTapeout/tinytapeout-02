# TinyTapeout project information
project:
  wokwi_id:    341438392303616596        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID
#  source_files:        # If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. Source files must be in ./src
#    - counter.v
#    - decoder.v
#  top_module:  "seven_segment_seconds"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  author:       "Jean THOMAS"      # Your name
  discord:      ""      # Your discord handle - make sure to include the # part as well
  title:        "Digital padlock"      # Project title
  description:  "A 4-digit electronic padlock"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "Each buttons press is detected by a rising edge detector, and each button press is decoded into a binary code. That binary code is stored in a shift-register which is continuously checked against a reference value ('the padlock code')."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Connect a clock generator to the clock input, connect all four buttons with a debounce circuit - the buttons should act as active high."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "Four push buttons, cabled as active high with hardware debounce circuitry."      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "wokwi" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  doc_link:     "README.md"      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     100       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required) we are expecting max clock frequency to be ~6khz. Provided on input 0.

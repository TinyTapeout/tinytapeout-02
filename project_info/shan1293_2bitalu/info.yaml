  top_module:  "shan1293_2bitalu"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.

# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "2bitALU"      # Project title
  description:  "2 bit ALU which performs 16 different operations"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "Based on the 4 bit opcode, the ALU performs 16 different operations on the 2 bit inputs A & B and stores the result in 8 bit output ALU_out"      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Provide A, B inputs. Select opcode based on the operation to perform. Check output at ALU_out"      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  ""      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc

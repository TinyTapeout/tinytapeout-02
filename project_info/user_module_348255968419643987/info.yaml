project:
  wokwi_id:    348255968419643987        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID
#  source_files:        # If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. Source files must be in ./src
#    - counter.v
#    - decoder.v
#  top_module:  "seven_segment_seconds"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "Tiny Synth"      # Project title
  description:  "A tiny synthesizer! Modulates the frequency of the clock based on inputs, plays a C scale (hopefully)."      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "Will come back and write more after my exams!"      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Make sure the clock is tied to input 0, whatever frequency you want, play with it! Then you can play different notes by toggling the other inputs."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "Not entirely sure yet, it outputs a square wave, I still need to figure out what to do with it to make it make sound."      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "wokwi" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  doc_link:     "Not done yet, eventually!"      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     12500       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required)
  picture:      "Not done yet."      # relative path to a picture in your repository

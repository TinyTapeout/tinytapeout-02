# TinyTapeout project information
project:
  wokwi_id:    0        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID
  source_files:        # If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. Source files must be in ./src
    - pwm_gen.v
  top_module:  "pwm_gen"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "Breathing LED"      # Project title
  description:  "Use the pwm output to drive an LED and it should look like it's breathing."      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "A triangle wave is generated and used to determine duty cycle of pwm."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "After reset, pwm should automatically be generated. The duty counter is output for debug purposes."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "Clock source and external LED circuit."      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "TinyTapeout2 4-bit multiplier."      # Project title
  description:  "Multiplies two 4-bit numbers presented on the input pins and outputs an 8-bit result."      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "The multiplier is implemented using purely combinatorial logic. One 6-bit adder and two 8-bit adders as well as a heap of AND gates are the only used components."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Input any two numbers on the input ports, and check if the 8-bit result is correct."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "DIP switches for the inputs, and LEDs on the outputs, to be able to read the binary result."      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  doc_link:     ""      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     6000       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required)

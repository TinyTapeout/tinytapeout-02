# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  description:  "Replication of TI's Little Logic 1G97 and 1G98 configurable logic gates."      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "This design replicates the circuit inside a TI configurable logic gates 74xx1G97 (and by including an inverted output, it will work as a 74xx1G98 as well). 
                 Since there are still I/O pins left, I included two of these configurables, and also one 74xx1G79 D Flip-Flop (again, an inverted output means this will also work as a 74xx1G80)."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "You could refer to TI's 1G79/1G80/1G97/1G98 datasheet to test the device according to the pinout listed below."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  ""      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "wokwi" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc

  clock_hz:     0       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required) we are expecting max clock frequency to be ~6khz. Provided on input 0.

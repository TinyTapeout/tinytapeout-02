# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.

# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "TrainLED2 - RGB-LED driver with 8 bit PWM engine"      # Project title
  description:  "A RGB-LED driver using the WS2812 protocol"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "A fully digital implementation of an RGB LED driver that accepts the WS2812 protocol for data input. The design is fully clocked, so the timing parameters of the protocol depend on the clock rate. A pulse between 1 and 5 clock cycles on the input will be interpreted as a zero, longer pulses as a one. Each driver accepts 3x8=24 bit of input data to set the brightness of LED1,LED2 and LED3 (R,G,B). After 24 bit have been received, additional input bits are retimed and forwarded to the data output.

  After the data input was idle for 96 clock cycles, the input data is latched into the PWM engine and the data input is ready for the next data frame.

  The PWM engine uses a special dithering scheme to allow flicker free LED dimming even for relatively low clock rates.  
  "      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Execute the shell script 'run.sh' in the src folder. This will invoke the test bench."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "LEDs should be connected to the three LED outputs. The data input should be driven by a microcontroller, generating input data in a slowed down WS2812 scheme."      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  doc_link:     "https://github.com/cpldcpu/tt02-TrainLED"      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     at least 6000   # Clock frequency in Hz (if required) we are expecting max clock frequency to be ~6khz. Provided on input 0.

  source_files:        # If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. Source files must be in ./src
    - frog.v
#    - decoder.v
  top_module:  "frog"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "FROG 4-Bit CPU"      # Project title
  description:  "The FROG is an extremely minimal load-store 4-bit CPU"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "The CPU addresses external memory on its addr pins and executes/interprets data on the data_in pins"      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Set data_in to 0x8 (NOP) and observe the addr bus count upward as the CPU executes Instructions"      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "An SRAM/ROM like memory containing instructions should be connected to addr/wcyc/data_in"      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  doc_link:     "README.md"      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     0       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required) we are expecting max clock frequency to be ~6khz. Provided on input 0.

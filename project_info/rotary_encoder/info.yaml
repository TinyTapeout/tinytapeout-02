  top_module:  "rotary_encoder"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "Rotary encoder"      # Project title
  description:  "Reads in a (incremental) rotary encoder and shows the result on the seven-segment display"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "The rotary pins are sampled every clock cycle. 
  If a rising edge is detected on pin A, the 4 bit counter will be incremented/decremented depending on pin B.
  The counter is put on the seven segment display and a debounce time is started (125 clk cycles) "      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "After reset, turn the rotary encoder and the counter should increment/decrement as you turn"      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "Rotary encoder connected to pin A and pin B"      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  doc_link:     ""      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     10000       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required)

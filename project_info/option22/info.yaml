  top_module:  "option22"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "Option22"      # Project title
  description:  "Looong shift register. 22x8 bit"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "write=high: Data is shifted-in on clock positive edge. Each 8 clocks a full byte is buffered at the output. It rotatetes all 22 words. Reset only resets internal counter for the bit index."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Keep write high and push 22x8 bits in. Keep clock with write low to recieve the bytes a the output"      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "Pink LEDs"      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc

  clock_hz:     0       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required) we are expecting max clock frequency to be ~6khz. Provided on input 0.

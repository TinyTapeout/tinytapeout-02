# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  description:  "This circuit will output a string of characters (’tiny tapeout’) to the 7-segment display."      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "The logic to light the characters appears in the bottom half of the simulation window. The top half of the simulation window implements a modulo-11 counter. In other words, the counter increments up to 11 then resets. This counter is used to determine which character we should output to the 7-segment display. The truth table for the design can be found in the Design Spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-h9pBYtuxv6su2EC8qBc6nX_JqHXks6Gx5nmHFQh_30/edit"
  how_to_test:  "Simply turn on and watch the characters on the 7-segment display. If needed, flip Input[1] (zero-indexed) ON to reset the state machine counter."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "None"      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "wokwi" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc

  clock_hz:     1       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required) we are expecting max clock frequency to be ~6khz. Provided on input 0.

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.

# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

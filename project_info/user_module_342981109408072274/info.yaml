#  source_files:        # If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. Source files must be in ./src
#    - counter.v
#    - decoder.v
#  top_module:  "seven_segment_seconds"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  how_to_test:  "
  input 1 - clock input
  input 2 - feed NOT LED 1 back into the shift register -- this creates a pattern where every other LED is switched on
  input 3 - feed 1 into the shift register if both the first two LEDs are off. This creates a pattern where every third LED is on
  input 4 - feed 1 into the shift register if the first three LEDs are off. This creates a pattern where every fourth LED is on
  input 5 - feed 1 into the shift register if all the LEDs are off. This creates a pattern of one light scanning across the LEDs
  input 6 - set the direction of the shift register
  input 7 - toggles fixed direction or alternating direction. If alternating direction is set, the direction of the shift register will flip if all the LEDs are off
  input 8 - enable the clock divider"     # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "A LED on each pin"      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "wokwi" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc

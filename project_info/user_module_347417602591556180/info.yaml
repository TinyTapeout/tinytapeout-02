project:
  wokwi_id:    347417602591556180        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID
#  source_files:        # If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. Source files must be in ./src
#    - counter.v
#    - decoder.v
#  top_module:  "seven_segment_seconds"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "Customizable Padlock"      # Project title
  description:  "This design implements a customizable padlock. Set a code for your digital safe!"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "Switch 2 is used to reset the safe. Switch 8 is used to set your code (on = set, off = locked). Switches 3 to 5 are used to set the code. The push button is used to enter your code."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Set your desired code using Switches 3 to 5. Once you’ve done so, toggle Switch 8 to on then back off–the safe is now set! Turn on Switch 2, and press the push button. The seven segment display should show “L” (for locked). Next turn off Switch 2 to begin entering codes. If you enter a correct code, thw seven segment display should show “U” (for unlocked)."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "None"      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "wokwi" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc

  clock_hz:     0       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required) we are expecting max clock frequency to be ~6khz. Provided on input 0.

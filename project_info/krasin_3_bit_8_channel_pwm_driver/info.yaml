# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "3-bit 8-channel PWM driver"      # Project title
  description:  "PWM driver with 8 channels and 8 PWM levels from 0 to 1"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "uses a 3-bit counter to drive PWM on 8 output channels. Each channel is controlled by a dedicated 3-bit register that specifies its PWM level: 0 means always off, 1 is for 1/7 on, 5 is for 5/7 on and 7 is 7/7 (always on)"  # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "after reset, all output pins will be low. Use set, addr<n> and level<n> pins to set PWM level=level0+2*level1+4*level2 on channel=addr0+2*addr1+4*addr2. The corresponding pin will start oscillating between 0 and 1 according to the clock and the set level."  # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  ""      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  doc_link:     ""      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     1000       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required)

  inputs:               # a description of what the inputs do
    - clock
    - pset # when 1, the value for the output pin with address=addr0+2*addr1+4*addr2 is set to the level=level0+2*level1+4*level2. When 0, addr and level pins are ignored.
    - addr0 # Low bit for pin address
    - addr1 # Mid bit for pin address
    - addr2 # High bit for pin address
    - level0 # Low bit for PWM level
    - level1 # Mid bit for PWM level
    - level2 # High bit for PWM level
  outputs:
    - out0 # channel 0 for PWM
    - out1 # channel 1 for PWM
    - out2 # channel 2 for PWM
    - out3 # channel 3 for PWM
    - out4 # channel 4 for PWM
    - out5 # channel 5 for PWM
    - out6 # channel 6 for PWM
    - out7 # channel 7 for PWM

  top_module:  "luthor2k_top_tto"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "Baudot Converter"      # Project title
  description:  "This circuit will convert ASCII serial data to baudot serial data provide the reverse funtion as well"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "UARTS and two conversion ROMs"      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Serial data in and see how it goes."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "The ASCII is expected to come in/out from a USB-serial adapter. The baudot is a 60mA current loop so something hefty is required."      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  doc_link:     ""      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     1000       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required)

  inputs:               # a description of what the inputs do
    - ascii clock at 8x desired baudrate
    - baudot clock at 100x desired baudrate
    - baudot input, should be held high when line is idle but connected

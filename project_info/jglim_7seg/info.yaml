# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "BCD to Hex 7-Segment Decoder"      # Project title
  description:  "Converts a 4-bit BCD input into a hexadecimal 7-segment display output"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "The IC accepts four binary-coded decimal input signals, and generates a corresponding hexadecimal 7-segment output signal. Segment outputs may be inverted with the INVERT pin to support both common cathode/anode displays."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Connect the segment outputs to a 7-segment display. Configure the input (IN0:0, IN1:2, IN2:4, IN3:8). The input value will be shown on the 7-segment display"      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "7-segment display"      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  doc_link:     "https://github.com/jglim/tt02-bcd-hex7seg-hdl/blob/main/README.md"      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     0       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required) we are expecting max clock frequency to be ~6khz. Provided on input 0.

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "TinyPID"      # Project title
  description:  "Tiny PID controller with SPI configuration channel, SPI ADC and DAC driver"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "TinyPID reads from a shift register, calculates error and PID values, and writes to a shift register. All parameters of this process are configurable."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Shift in config, then shift in PV input and see what happens. There are three bytes of configuration (setpoint, kp, ki), which are zero on startup."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "One shift register / ADC for PV read, one shift register / DAC for stimulus output."       # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  doc_link:     "https://github.com/AidanMedcalf/tt02-pid/blob/main/README.md"      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     1       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required) we are expecting max clock frequency to be ~6khz. Provided on input 0.

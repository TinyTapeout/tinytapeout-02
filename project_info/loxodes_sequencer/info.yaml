  author:       "Jon Klein"      # Your name
  discord:      "loxodes"      # Your discord handle
  title:        "Power supply sequencer"      # Project title
  description:  "Sequentially enable and disable channels with configurable delay"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "Counters and registers control and track the state of channel activations. The delay input sets the counter threshold."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "After reset, bring enable high to enable channels sequentially, starting with channel 0. Bring enable low to switch off channels sequentially, starting with channel 7."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "None, but could be useful for GaAs amplifiers or other circuits which need sequenced power supplies."      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  doc_link:     ""      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     12500       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required)

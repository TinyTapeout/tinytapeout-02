# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "chase the beat"      # Project title
  description:  "Tap twice to the beat, the outputs will chase the beat. Or generate some audio noise!"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "The second button press sets a ceiling value for the 1kHz counter. When the counter hits that value, it barrel-shifts the outputs by one bit. When the mode pin isn't asserted, the first output pin emits digital noise generated by a LFSR"      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Set 1kHz clock on first input. After reset, set mode to 1, tap the tap button twice within one second. The outputs should set to the beat"
  external_hw:  "A button on the tap input, a switch on the mode input, LEDs on the 8 outputs, and audio output on the first output. Don't just connect headphones or speakers directly! It could fry the circuit, you need some sort of amplifier."      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "amaranth" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc

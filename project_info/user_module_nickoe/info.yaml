# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "LEDChaser from LiteX test"      # Project title
  description:  "This is just a small demo of synthezing verilog from LiteX, this does not include any CPU."      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "It just implements LEDChaser from the LiteX LED core demo, where io_in[3:7] is duty cycle"      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Add LEDs on the outputs in a straight line -- or probe all signals on a scope and check that you get a 'moving' train of pulses."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  ""      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "LiteX/Migen/Verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  doc_link:     ""      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     0       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required) we are expecting max clock frequency to be ~6khz. Provided on input 0.

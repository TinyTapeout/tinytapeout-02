project:
  wokwi_id:    348195845106041428        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID
#  source_files:        # If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. Source files must be in ./src
#    - counter.v
#    - decoder.v
#  top_module:  "seven_segment_seconds"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  author:       "argunda"      # Your name
  discord:      "catbeans"      # Your discord handle
  title:        "Tiny Phase/Frequency Detector"      # Project title
  description:  "Detect phase shifts between 2 square waves."      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "This is one of the blocks of a phased locked loop. The inputs are a reference clock and feedback clock and the outputs are the phase difference on either up or /down pin."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "If the phase of the feedback clock is leading the reference clock, the up signal should show the phase difference. If it's lagging, the down signal will show the difference."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "Signal generators for square wave inputs."      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "wokwi" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc

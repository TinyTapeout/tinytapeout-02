  top_module:  "meriac_tt02_play_tune"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  description:  "Plays Super Mario Tune over a Piezo Speaker connected across io_out[1:0]"  # Short description of what your project does
                                                                                            # Longer description of how the project works
  how_it_works: "Converts an RTTL ringtone into verilog using Python - and plays it back using differential PWM modulation"
                                                                                            # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  "Provide 3kHz clock on io_in[0], briefly hit reset io_in[1] (L->H->L) and io_out[1:0] will play a differential sound wave over piezo speaker (Super Mario)"

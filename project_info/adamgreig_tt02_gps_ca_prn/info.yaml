# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "GPS C/A PRN Generator"
  description:  "Generate the GPS C/A PRN sequences PRN1 through PRN32"
  how_it_works: "Two LFSRs are constructed per the GPS ICD, and the first is added to selected taps of the second to produce the selected final PRN sequence."
  how_to_test:  "With io_in[2:7] set to 2 to select PRN2, reset and then drive the clock; the output sequence on io_out[2] will start with 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1."

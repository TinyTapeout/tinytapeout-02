# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "Beep Boop Traffic Light Controller"      # Project title
  description:  "Sequencer for a traffic light with a walk button, with timings tuned to match the iconic 'beep boop' streetlight formerly installed in front of Carnegie Mellon University"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "Press the walk button and the traffic light will turn red, then the walk signal and 'beep boop' will begin"      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "See inputs and outputs"      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "LEDs, noisemaker, button"      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "SystemVerilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc

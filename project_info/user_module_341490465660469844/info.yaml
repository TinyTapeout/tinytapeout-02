#  top_module:  "seven_segment_seconds"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  description:  "Drives 7-segment LED display, alternating between NIC and JAC"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "Master clock is fed through a prescaler with four tap-points which feeds a 4-bit ripple counter (there are 6 total bits, but the top two bits are discarded). 2:1 muxes are chained to act like a 8:1 mux for each LED segment position. As the counter runs, this results in each segment being turned on or off as needed to render the display sequence (NIC JAC ).  The highest order bit is used to blink the decimal point on/off. "      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "IN5 and IN6 selects the clock prescaler. OUT0-OUT7 are the LED segment outputs."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "TTO standard switches and 7-segment display"      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "wokwi" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  doc_link:     ""      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     0       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required) we are expecting max clock frequency to be ~6khz. Provided on input 0.

# TinyTapeout project information
project:
  wokwi_id:    348381622440034899        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID
#  source_files:        # If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. Source files must be in ./src
#    - counter.v
#    - decoder.v
#  top_module:  "timvgso_worm_in_a_maze"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

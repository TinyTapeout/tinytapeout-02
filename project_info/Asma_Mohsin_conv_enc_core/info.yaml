# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "channel coding"      # Project title
  description:  "Convolutional coding is widely used in modern digital communication systems.We often get encoded data by using different polynomials having same constraint lengths (K)."      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "We have two polynomials of 4th order and a shift register of 5 bits. we take input data of a single bit and put it in shift register on each clock edge as long as valid data bit is asserted. after this codeword is calculated by taking xor of the and of polynomial and shift register"      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "apply clk,reset ,data valid and input data and do calculations to see if output is equal to the desired one"      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  ""      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc

  clock_hz:     6000      # Clock frequency in Hz (if required) we are expecting max clock frequency to be ~6khz. Provided on input 0.

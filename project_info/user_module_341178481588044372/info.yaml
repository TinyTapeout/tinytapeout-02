# TinyTapeout project information
project:
  wokwi_id:    341178481588044372        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID
#  source_files:        # If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. Source files must be in ./src
#    - counter.v
#    - decoder.v
#  top_module:  "seven_segment_seconds"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "LED Chaser"      # Project title
  description:  "Push the button to fill in segments of the LED display, they will continue to shift and fill in the display until the button is released.`"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "Input is button to input of shift register. Each segment of the 7 segment display is connected to an output of the shift register."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Push switch number 8 to watch the LEDs fill in"      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "None"      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "wokwi" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  doc_link:     ""      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     0       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required) we are expecting max clock frequency to be ~6khz. Provided on input 0.

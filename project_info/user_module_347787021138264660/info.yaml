# TinyTapeout project information
project:
  wokwi_id:    347787021138264660        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID
#  source_files:        # If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. Source files must be in ./src
#    - counter.v
#    - decoder.v
#  top_module:  "seven_segment_seconds"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  description:  "Using external hardware photodiodes as inputs, display light intensity on the 7-segment display"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "Inputs 1-6 will be connected to external photodiodes to read either a '0' or '1', inputs will be added together and displayed on the 7-segment display"      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Dip switches 1-6 can be used instead of external hw to provide inputs, and 7 is used to switch between Step or Continous sample mode. Throw the switches and the total number should show up on the 7-segment display"      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "Breadboard, resistors, photodiodes, specific part# TBD"      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "wokwi" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc

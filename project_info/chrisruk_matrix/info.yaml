  title:        "Scrolling Binary Matrix display"      # Project title
  description:  "Display scrolling binary data from input pin on 8x8 SK9822 LED matrix display"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "Uses 8x8 matrix SK9822 LED display to scroll binary data as 0s and 1s in a simple font, from the input pin.  Designed in verilog and tested using iCEstick FPGA Evaluation Kit.  Each LED takes a 32 bit value, consisting of r,g,b and brightness."            # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Need 8x8 matrix SK9822 LED display and level shifter to convert output clock and data logic to 5V logic."
  external_hw:  "Requires 8x8 matrix SK9822 LED display and 3.3V to 5V logic level shifter to convert the data and clock signals to the correct voltage for the display."      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc

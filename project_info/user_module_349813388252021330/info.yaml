#  source_files:        # If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. Source files must be in ./src
#    - counter.v
#    - decoder.v
#  top_module:  "seven_segment_seconds"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "4:2 Compressor"      # Project title
  description:  "A Basic 4:2 compressor which contains 4 inputs and 1 carry_in bit which compresses to 2 outputs and 1 carry_out bit"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "It compressors 4 inputs to 2 inputs. This is used to compress partial products inside multipliers"      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Follow the truth table of 4:2 compressor online with 4 inputs and carry_in bit and observe the 2 outputs and carry_out bit"      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  ""      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "wokwi" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  doc_link:     ""      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     0       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required) we are expecting max clock frequency to be ~6khz. Provided on input 0.

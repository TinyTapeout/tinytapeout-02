  top_module:  "option23ser"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "Option23 Serial"      # Project title
  description:  "Character ROM and bitmap shifter for POV displays"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "clock: clocks out character columns or shifts in data. Data is 8bits LSB first. Highest bit is ignored. Data = b01xxxxxx ASCII character no x + 32. data = b00xxxxxx bitmap column. under/over is underline and overline for all bitmap columns"      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Shift in some data and set din = 1111111 to clock out characters and graphics"      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "Pink LEDs"      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  doc_link:     ""      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     0       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required) we are expecting max clock frequency to be ~6khz. Provided on input 0.

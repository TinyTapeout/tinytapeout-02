project:

  source_files:        # If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. Source files must be in ./src
    - counter.v
    - decoder.v
  top_module:  "xor_shift32_quantamhd"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "XorShift32"      # Project title
  description:  "XorShift32 random number generator"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "Uses the Xorshift32 algorithm to generate a random 32 bit number. Number is truncated to 3 bits and displayed"      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "While reset is set, hardware reads in seed value from input bits 2:7 and sets the inital seed as that binary number. After reset is deasserted, the hardware will generate a new number every 1000 clock cycles."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  ""      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  doc_link:     ""      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     1000       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required)

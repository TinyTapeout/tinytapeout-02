  title:        "BCD to 7-segment encoder"
  description:  "Encode binary coded decimals (BCD) in the range 0..9 to 7-segment display control signals"
  how_it_works: "The design has been fully generated using https://github.com/maehw/wokwi-lookup-table-generator using a truth table (https://github.com/maehw/wokwi-lookup-table-generator/blob/main/demos/bcd_7segment_lut.logic.json). The truth table describes the translation of binary coded decimal (BCD) numbers to wokwi 7-segment display (https://docs.wokwi.com/parts/wokwi-7segment). Valid BCD input values are in the range 0..9, other values will show a blank display."
  how_to_test:  "Control the input switches on the PCB and check the digit displayed on the 7-segment display."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "Input switches and 7-segment display (should be on the PCB)"
  language:     "wokwi"

# TinyTapeout project information
project:
  wokwi_id:    349011320806310484        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID
#  source_files:        # If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. Source files must be in ./src
#    - counter.v
#    - decoder.v
#  top_module:  "seven_segment_seconds"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  author:       "Shaos"      # Your name
  discord:      "Shaos#3571"      # Your discord handle - make sure to include the # part as well
  title:        "GOL-Cell"      # Project title
  description:  "Game of Life Cell"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "Calculate survive/die decision based on number of neighbours and current state"      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Change number of neighbours and see"      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "8 neighbours and rerouted current state need to go in 2 stages using 5 inputs"      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "wokwi" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  doc_link:     ""      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     0       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required) we are expecting max clock frequency to be ~6khz. Provided on input 0.
  picture:      "wokwi-sch.png"      # relative path to a picture in your repository
  inputs:               # a description of what the inputs do
    - clock
    - reset # clean all flip-flops synchronously
    - half # "0" for 1st half and "1" for 2nd half (last input is always current state)
    - input 0 or 5
    - input 1 or 6
    - input 2 or 7
    - input 3 or 8
    - input 4 or 9 # current state (connected from output or independent input for testing)
  outputs:
    - segment a  # current state
    - segment b  # current state
    - segment c
    - segment d  # re-routed input 9 (just in case)
    - segment e
    - segment f  # current state
    - segment g  # current state
    - inverted clock

  top_module:  "option23"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  description:  "Character ROM and bitmap shifter for POV displays"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "clock: clocks out character columns or shifts in data. din = 1111111: show characters and bitmaps column by column. din = 1xxxxxx shift in ASCII character x. din = b10xxxxx : shift in bitmap column xxxxx"      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Shift in some data and set din = 1111111 to clock out characters and graphics"      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  description:  "one fracturable 5-LUT that receives FPGA LUT configuration frames, serially evaluates LUT inputs and LUT outputs"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "The design is a single physical LUT into which an external agent pours a series of 92b LUT configuration frames, four bits per cycle. Every 23 clock cycles it evaluates a 5-input LUT. The last N=283 LUT output values are kept on die to be used as LUT inputs of subsequent LUTs. The design also has 2 FPGA input pins and 7 FPGA output pins."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "tricky"      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "serial SRAM or FLASH"      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc

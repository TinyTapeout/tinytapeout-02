# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "Chisel 16-bit GCD with scan in and out"      # Project title
  description:  "Simple chisel based design based on Knuth's BinaryGDC algorithm using scan chains for I/O."
  how_it_works: "With the `ld` signal true, the `u_bit` and `v_bit` inputs are used to scan the `n`-bit numbers into the block. Simulataneously, the high-order bit of the `u` register is scanned out, allowing access to the result of the last computation. Upon lowering the `ld` signal, the Euclid iteration starts. When done, the `done` signal is raised."
  how_to_test:  "Chiseltest enabled tests. Go to `chisel` and run `sbt test`."
  external_hw:  "None"      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "Chisel" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc

  clock_hz:     0       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required) we are expecting max clock frequency to be ~6khz. Provided on input 0.

  top_module:  "ericsmi_speed_test"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "Ring OSC Speed Test"      # Project title
  description:  "Make two rings with the same number of stages but measure how their frequency differs.  Measure if they can influence eachother."      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "uses a register and some combinational logic"      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "after reset, assert trigger.  Use sel bits to get result"      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "Something to sequence nrst, ring_en, trig and the sel bits"      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc

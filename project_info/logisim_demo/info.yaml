# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "Logisim demo - LED blinker"      # Project title
  description:  "Example of how to use Logisim Evolution generated Verilog for TinyTapeout."      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "Its a 4-bit ring-shift register with a single '1' cycling through it after reset."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "After starting the clock, the 4 outputs will remain off or in a random state until the reset input is activated. Then it should work as described."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "A button for reset, some way to display the output (LEDs)"      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc

Add last set of designs
used projects.bz previously uploaded to gdrive
would be easy to overwrite all the newly rehardened gds with the ones from the repos
only rehardened 165 as it had a changed config, the rest were all with the latest config

needed to change io def for 165 as it only had 2 inputs

160 -> 164 fetched gds from github

rebuilt scanchain

rebuilt scan_controller (first checked set to 250 designs)

then setup caravel

./configure --update-caravel

make user_project_wrapper

rebuilt datasheet

# Mon  4 Dec 

all needed the original golden config:
set ::env(PL_BASIC_PLACEMENT) {1}

except 106
